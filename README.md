# Productbox-QA-Assessment

##### Hello! Your task is to test basic e-commerce website.
## Getting Started

##### I have provided you the html file in this repo which you can simply download or you may clone this repository and test it.

## Overview

##### Please test it thoroughly both at frontend and at code level. (black box and white box testing)

## Submission

##### I would like you to understand how the bug cycle works: https://www.toolsqa.com/software-testing/defect-life-cycle/ and report bugs as per JIRA standards (For Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWxMTvRGIpc). All the bugs you have identified should be considered as a seperate ticket. One ticket/bug can have sub-ticket/bug. In this particular app, we are assuming all bugs would be in ‘New’ state.

##### You need to submit a PDF document which has a table with ticket #, ticket description, ticket explanation, sub-tickets, and any other field that you believe is necessary. It should be easy to read and understand. The main thing is communication here so any bug you identified should be explained briefly. 

## Bonus

   ##### 1. Fix few of the problems you identified and email the html file as well.
   ##### 2. Suggest solution to the problem.
   ##### 3. Identify problem at the code level and suggest the solution to the engineer.
